									<h2><a href="#">Sunshine Resort Customer Analysis</a></h2>
									<p>I participated in a project that involved analyzing hotel data from 2015 to 2017 using Microsoft Excel to create a comprehensive visualization dashboard. The analysis focused on several key metrics, including the average length of stay by customers on weekdays versus weekends, the number of guests by country, the number of customers who booked through agents, guest attendance across different months, the top 10 most utilized rooms, the total number of booking changes, types of deposits made during reservations, and the number of repeat guests.
										The analysis revealed several critical insights. First, we found that the average length of stay was higher on weeknights compared to weekends. Based on this finding, we recommended that the hotel management introduce fun games and activities during weekends to attract more customers.
									   Additionally, it was observed that the majority of the hotel’s customers came from Europe. We suggested that management should enhance marketing efforts in other continents to diversify the customer base.
									   The data also showed that the hotel experienced its highest number of guests between April and October. To optimize resource allocation, we recommended that the hotel reduce or adjust resources during months with lower guest numbers to minimize financial losses. Alternatively, management could consider implementing special activities or promotions during these off-season months to attract more customers.
									   These insights were instrumental in helping the hotel refine its operational strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource management

										<h2><a href="#">Northwind Store Revenue Analysis Using Power BI</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Northwind Store.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data from a store that handles shipping orders nationwide, covering the period from April 2023 to May 2024. Utilizing Power BI, I developed a comprehensive visualization dashboard that highlighted key performance indicators such as total revenue, total orders, total quantity sold, and revenue trends segmented by year, month, product, and employee.
										The analysis revealed that the store experienced peak revenue during the months of August 2023, November 2023, February 2024, March 2024, and May 2024. Based on these findings, we identified the need to optimize resources and inventory levels for the months of April through August 2023, October 2023, December 2023, January 2024, and April 2024, to better capitalize on anticipated demand spikes.
										The recommendations derived from this analysis, including resource optimization, product promotion strategies, and employee training programs, were implemented and resulted in a 30% increase in sales starting from June 2024. These insights played a crucial role in driving the store's overall sales growth and improving operational efficiency.

										<h2><a href="#">Designing An Instore Pick Up Process Flow Chart Using draw.io</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/instore pickup flow.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I collaborated with a team to design a process flow map for an in-store pickup process using the draw.io tool. This initiative successfully streamlined the collection and delivery of orders, significantly reducing the likelihood of setbacks, delays, and overcrowding within the store. The enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of the pickup process resulted in reduced pickup times, increased customer satisfaction, and ultimately led to a 15% boost in revenue due to a rise in customer numbers.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Automated Computerized Loan Approval Business Case</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/loan process.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I took part in developing and working on a business case for a bank proposing to the management for the loan approval process to be changed from a manual paper intensive process to a computerized automated loan approval process, which was meant to easily address frequent customer dissatisfaction, reduce risk of error/bottlenecks and compliance issues. Since the manual loan approval process presented a number of recurrent challenges such as high customer dissatisfaction, error prone manual processes (high risk of human errors), process bottlenecks and increased compliance risks (susceptible to incomplete and incorrect documentation). After adopting the computerized automated loan approval system which was characterized by automated data entry, workflow automation, digital document management, compliance monitoring and customer communication. Enhanced customer satisfaction, increased accuracy and efficiency, improved compliance and operational cost savings were significant improvements experienced by the bank after adopting our proposed computerized automated loan approval process. And also the bank also experienced a 10% increase in the number of customers.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Carrying out A Business Analysis On An Inventory Management System In an Organisation</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/inventory project.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>We were approached by an organization’s inventory management department to address recurring issues of stock outs and overstock situations, which were leading to delays, increased costs and customer dissatisfaction. These challenges were significantly impacting the organization’s revenue and causing unnecessary expenses.
										To address these issues, our team conducted a comprehensive business analysis of the existing inventory management system. We began by clearly defining the problem: frequent stock outs and overstock situations. Our primary objective was to identify the root causes of these inventory imbalances and develop a solution to mitigate them.
										We then structured the project using the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework.
										After implementing the new system, the organization experienced a 10% increase in revenue in the following months, and customer satisfaction improved significantly. This successful outcome demonstrated the effectiveness of our analysis and the value of a well-designed inventory management system.

										<h2><a href="#">ANALYSIS CARRIED ON HOSPITAL TRANSACTIONS</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/hospital.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>We worked on a complex analysis using Power BI, examining data from three different years for a hospital. The analysis focused on metrics such as total revenue, expenses, profit, number of doctors, top-performing doctors, revenue-generating patients, and patient visits by year and quarter.
										The findings revealed the need for some doctors to undergo further training, while others were recommended for layoff to make room for hiring more skilled professionals. Additionally, it was suggested that expenses be reduced during quarters with lower patient counts. After implementing these recommendations, the hospital experienced a 5% increase in revenue.</p>
